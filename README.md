# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
This is a more sophisticated version of round robin CPU scheduling algorithm combined with Shortest Job First and has dynamic quantum time.

Fully menu driven code which can compute average waiting time and average turn-around time for many algorithms like:

• First Come First Serve

• Shortest Job First

• Round Robin

• Shortest Remaining Time First

• Improved Round Robin

• Improved Round Robin with mean Time Quantum

• Improved Round Robin with min Time Quantum

• Improved Round Robin Shortest Job First

• Improved Round Robin Shortest Job First with dynamic Time Quantum

Can also compare the performance of the above listed algorithms by calculating average waiting time and average turn-around time for all algorithms together.
